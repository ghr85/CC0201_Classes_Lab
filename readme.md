# Codeclan Week 02 Day 01

## Classes, Objects & Instance Vari@bles

## Topics to be covered today:
* Object Oriented Programming
* Class creation
* Object instantiation
* Accessor methods
* behaviours

## Afternoon Lab (Solo)

You are given details of 3 distinct classes which need to be modelled as part
of a solo lab. What remains will be taken away from the day as homework.

Stick to your principles you learned last week:
* Test first, make it fail, code it to pass, test again, refactor
* Keep your variable names tight
* Watch the console
* Remember, you always want to test first and FAIL, this lets you know your passes are solid.

### A Students Class

* Take it slow, nearly a repeat of classwork for this one.


### B Teams Class

* Members of a different class - even in a related test file, will not have access to instance variables.
* Inspect? Perhaps needs a code block - could not get a true or false return on an array? Regardless, iterated.
* Ctrl Shift R, keep formatting so you can see where functions close


### C Library Class

* Hashes make everything difficult if just for scrollability.
* Watch out for commas while using asset equal, particularly when using hashes.
* Take breaks or the screen will turn your eyes to fudge.


## Notes

Order of approach:

* Write it down on paper first - split it up into attributes and behaviours, understand what needs built.
* Set up directory, spec files and source code files, create Git repository and get that first commit in.
* Get your test requirements, file requirements and headers down then draw down from MiniTest to create test class.
* Create setup data in test file to be used - create an @object of type to be tested.
* Create class in source file. Create initialize method.
* Begin creating test functions, let it fail, then code it to pass.
* Commit once passed. Keep a record, keep it clean.
